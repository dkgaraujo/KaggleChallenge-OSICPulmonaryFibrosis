# KaggleChallenge-OSICPulmonaryFibrosis
This is a repository for some ideas submitted to [Kaggle challenge on pulmonary fibrosis](https://www.kaggle.com/c/osic-pulmonary-fibrosis-progression). *Note: if you have any idea or code suggestion, feel free to commit them. I would love to see different implementations, in particular more effective ways to write the code.*

Currently, I have a code that uses only tabular data (ie, does not incorporate the information from CT scans of patients' lungs) to estimate a Bayesian log linear model. Or rather two models: one for smoker patients and the other for the others.
